# Conventional PR Title Workflow
#
# Why this exists:
# We use conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, chore:, etc.) for our PR titles.
# This keeps our git history clean and helps generate changelogs automatically.
#
# What it does:
# - Checks that your PR title follows conventional commit format
# - Examples: "feat: add user auth", "fix: resolve memory leak", "chore: update deps"
# - Runs on every PR to master
#
# If it fails:
# Just edit your PR title to match the format. The check will re-run automatically.
#
# DO NOT EDIT: Managed by Terraform at https://github.com/usetero/infrastructure
