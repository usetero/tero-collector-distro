# Release Please Workflow
#
# Why this exists:
# Manually creating releases and writing changelogs is tedious and error-prone.
# This workflow automates it based on your conventional commit messages.
#
# What it does:
# - Watches master branch for new commits
# - Creates a "release PR" that updates version numbers and changelog
# - When you merge that PR, it automatically creates a GitHub release
# - Uses your PR titles (feat:, fix:, etc.) to generate the changelog
#
# How it works:
# 1. Merge PRs to master as normal
# 2. Release Please opens a PR with version bump and changelog
# 3. Review and merge the release PR
# 4. GitHub release is created automatically
#
# DO NOT EDIT: Managed by Terraform at https://github.com/usetero/infrastructure
